*DESCRIPTION*:
This quiz app is a simple but fun little project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets users go through a set of multiple-choice questions and gives instant feedback — so you know right away if your answer was correct or not. As you play, your score is tracked and shown at the end. The app is also mobile-friendly, so it looks and works great on phones, tablets, and desktops. The questions load dynamically, and the design is clean and easy to use. It’s perfect for learning, training, or just challenging your friends. Plus, it's easy to customize — you can add more questions, different topics, or even a timer if you want. Great for anyone learning JavaScript and looking to build something real and interactive!
